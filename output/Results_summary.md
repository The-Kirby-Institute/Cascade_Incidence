## Results summary

This document gives a summary of the results generated by the cascade incidence analysis. It is primarily used to keep track of results which are stored in time of simulation specified folders. A number of these folders include experiments to assess the sensitivity of the results to priors and the approach.

### Analysis variations
There are two forms of analysis variations. One specifies the approach to setting up the priors and the other specifies the prior distribution for the suppressed multiplicative factor. 

- The "independent" approach specifies uniform distributions for the first three betas by specifying a minimum and maximum value designed to be large enough to cover all likely values. 
- The "relative" approach specifies priors for the multiplicative factor relative to the beta for diagnosed. The prior distribution for this factor is then multiplied by a uniform distribution for the error in the cascade stage estimate. 

For the f4 prior we consider multiple options. The distribution is based on the results from the Cohen et. al. NEJM paper which estimated someone with suppressed virus had a hazard ratio of 0.04 (95% CI: 0.01-0.27). We also explore distributions with a lower efficacy to account for the fact that this was in a trial population and didn't include changes in behaviour.

- Option 1: Beta distribution
- Option 2: Beta distribution
- Option 3: Triangle distribution
- Option 4: Triangle distribution
- Option 5: Triangle distribution
- Option 6: Truncated log-normal distribution
- Option 7: Truncated log-normal distribution
- Option 8: Truncated log-normal distribution 

### Folders
- **Cascade\_Analysis\_2016-03-29(16-09)**: This folder contains the results from the standard regression analysis.
- **Cascade\_Bayes\_2016-04-14(11-10)**: Million samples of the priors, relative scenario, option 6 for f4 third (first truncated log-normal option). Called high efficacy scenario.
- **Cascade\_Bayes\_2016-04-14(13-02)**: Million samples of the priors, relative scenario, option 7 for f4 third (second truncated log-normal option). Called medium efficacy scenario.
- **Cascade\_Bayes\_2016-04-14(14-32)**: Million samples of the priors, independent scenario, option 8 for f4 third (third truncated log-normal option). Called low efficacy scenario.

### Main Results

The main results used are the high efficacy scenario in the **Cascade\_Bayes\_2016-04-14(11-10)** folder.
